str(t3)
#\d+: This matches one or more digits (0-9). The + symbol indicates that the preceding pattern (in this case, a digit) can be repeated at least once.
#\.: This matches a literal dot (.). It escapes the dot because a dot in a regular expression has special meaning (matching any character).
#\d*: This matches zero or more digits (0-9). The * symbol indicates that the preceding pattern (a digit) can be repeated zero or more times.
##Example:
##Consider the string "35.22%":
##The first \\d+ matches "35".
##The \\. matches the dot (.).
##The second \\d* matches "22".
##Therefore, the entire regular expression successfully extracts the numeric part "35.22" from the percentage string.
##Incorporating into str_extract():
#The str_extract() function in dplyr uses this regular expression to search within the formatted_percentage column of your data frame t3. It then returns only the matching parts (the numeric values) as a new column named numeric_percentage.
